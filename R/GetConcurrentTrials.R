#' Get the Number of Concurrent Trials for Each Date in a Set of Studies
#'
#' This function computes the number of concurrent clinical trials for each date within a given set of studies.
#' It is particularly useful for understanding the distribution and overlap of clinical trials over time.
#'
#' @param d The studies to get the number of concurrent trials for.
#' @return A tibble with a `date` column and a `count` of the number of
#'         concurrent trials at that date.
