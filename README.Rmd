The goal of bis620.2023 is to provide a set of tools and a Shiny application for analyzing and exploring clinical trials data. This package is designed for the BIS620 class and offers functionalities for data processing and visualization, along with an interactive Shiny application for in-depth data exploration.

## Installation

You can install the development version of bis620.2023 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ivanwu233/bis620.2022")
```
